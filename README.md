## My process
1. Design was carefully analyzed

3. Container elements were placed as viewed from the design
4. Worked on the style sheet from top to bottom of the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### Continued development

For future development, I plan on working practcing more basic HTML and CSS while integrating my new knowledge on CSS Flexbox and Grid
